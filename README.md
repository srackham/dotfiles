# Chezmoi Managed Dotfiles

17-Sep-2024

My cross-distribution Linux dotfiles managed by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## Applications
Here's the list of application configurations managed by Chezmoi:

- bash
- GNOME desktop shortcuts (installed manually)
- Helix
- lazygit
- neovim
- nushell
- recoll
- Remmina
- tmux
- Vim
- Vimium (installed manually)
- zsh

## Manually Exported/Imported Configurations
The `exported` directory contains files that are managed manually:

- _Browser Bookmarks_: Exported from Brave browser.
  * Open [Bookmarks Manager](brave://bookmarks/) (C-S-o).
  * Run the _Export bookmarks_ command in the â‹® menu (vertical ellipsis menu, top right) and save bookmarks file to `~/.local/share/chezmoi/exported/bookmarks.html`.

- _GNOME Desktop key bindings_:

    * Export GNOME custom key bindings with:

            dconf dump /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/ > exported/gnome-custom-key-bindings.dconf

    * Use the dconf load command to restore custom GNOME key binding from the dump file. See `./exported/post-install-config.sh` for details.


- _Vimium Options_: The Vimium browser extension options are in the `vimium-options.json` file. Manually save and restore them using the backup and restore commands on the _Backup and Restore_ section of the Vimium extension Options page.
