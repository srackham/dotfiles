I am just beginning to learn Spanish (Castilian Spanish).
I would like the you to generate a common Spanish phrase/sentence and then ask me to translate to English.

- Include stress accent marks.
- Include an English Approximation Notation pronunciation guide with the phrases and indicate syllabic stress with capitals e.g. Gracias por todo (GRAH-see-ahs pohr TOH-doh).
- I'll put answers in double-quotes, everything else is a request or a comment.
- Evaluate my answer.
- If I respond with "n" then repeat with a new phrase.
- Don't move to an new phrase until I answer "n".
- If I respond with "g" then print a grammatical phrase analysis of the current phrase.
